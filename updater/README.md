# Updater

The updater script is a highly customizable script made for any bash developer to use. It's highly customizable, and it's open source. No need to write your own updater! To use, take the contents of ``updater.sh``, and input it somewhere in your code! This project is designed to use a config, if you are a Bash developer you will know how to merge the config with the updater, or we free to take the main code, and rewrite parts of it for your project!
