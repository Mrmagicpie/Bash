# IP Updater

Hey, wow, you found this! I'm impressed lmao. This is a script that will update your IP on a remote machine every set amount of time(defaults to 1h). This is a highly customizable script. If you do not have a config please run the script with ``bash update_ip.sh``. **Note:** This only supports Debian based OS's.
